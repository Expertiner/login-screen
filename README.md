# CSS - Login Screen with Dark Theme

This is a simple login screen with dark theme coded with only HTML and CSS.

It's is my personal version of the [original project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69-WfrVBli8&list=PLGTK_wPcnd_o2968V2gSU5EszKBO3ffYc&index=4) from the YouTube channel [Markzuel](https://www.youtube.com/@Markzuel).

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Media Queries

### What I learned

- Improved my Semantic HTML markup skills.
  >By using `main`, `section` and `article` instead of a simple `div`.

- How to inspect an element, on the browser, by hover the mouse over it.
  >On Chrome element's inspection window, on the top left, click on the square with the arrow inside it.

- How to see the responsiveness, on the browser, on element inspection.
  >On Chrome element's inspection window, on the top left, click on the laptop with the smartphone.

- When using `flex-direction: column;`, `justify-content` and `align-text` change axis.

- Improved my margin and padding knowledge.
  >By using the right references to set width and height.
  >- `vw` and `vh` - relative to the user's screen. The content will adjust to the screen size whenever it is changed.
  >
  >Setting the great parent `<main>` with viewport settings will make the children follow its pattern.
  >
  >You may use `%` on the children. Because the father will resize acording to the user settings, and the children will follow it.
  >
  >- `%` - relative to the parent container

- The concept of CSS Media Queries.
  >The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

### Continued development

- Concepts I'm still not completely comfortable with:
  - CSS Media Queries
  - HTML Forms

- Techniques I want to refine and perfect:
  -  `width` and `height`
